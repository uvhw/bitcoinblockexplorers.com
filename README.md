### Getting Started

The site aims to provide the information you need to understand Bitcoin and start building Bitcoin-based applications. To make the best use of this documentation, make sure youâ€™re running a node.

For technical support, we recommend Bitcoin Stack Exchange. For errors or suggestions related to this documentation, please open an issue on GitHub.

### Acknowledgments

This documentation would not be possible without the many contributions to the Bitcoin project over the years from core developers and other people. A very special thanks, however, goes to David Harding who in 2014 helped lead the effort to compose and bring together a significant amount of the material found here. Also, to Cornelius Schumacher for envisioning new ways to extend the developer documentation that led to this site.
